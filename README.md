# Summary

Clone of [react-github-mark](https://github.com/kengho/react-github-mark) with pretty much same API but for VueJS. Comes in form of simple `.vue` file (and some pics), so `vue-loader` is required (if you use `vue-cli`, you probably already have that). Package is bootstrapped using `vue create vue-github-mark`.
